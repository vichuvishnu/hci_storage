    The Cinder project team would like to point out some issues addressed
    by this release:

    * This release improves the handling of the ``__DEFAULT__`` volume-type
      (see "Other Notes", below) and fixes `Bug #1879578
      <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1879578>`_, in which the
      default type was applied too aggressively (see the discussion of
      this issue in "Bug Fixes", below).

    * Operators affected by `OSSN-0086
      <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OSSN/OSSN-0086>`_ should note that
      this release updates the os-brick library used by cinder to version
      3.0.3 in order to address an issue associated with the previous
      fixes for `Bug #1823200
      <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1823200>`_.

    os-brick release.

    See the `os-brick 3.0.3 release notes
    <https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/os-brick/ussuri.html#relnotes-3-0-3-stable-ussuri>`_
